### sub-pixel CNN
This [model](https://github.com/IvoryCandy/super-resolution/tree/master/sub_pixel_CNN) illustrates how to use the efficient sub-pixel convolution layer described in ["Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network" - Shi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158) for increasing spatial resolution within your network for tasks such as superresolution.
